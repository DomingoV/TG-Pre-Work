$ npm init package.json
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible de
faults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
